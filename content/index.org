#+title: artiombn's Blog

Hi, welcome to my blog!
I like programming.

I enjoy learning the principles of programming,
such as the /environment model/ of evaluation from [[https://sarabander.github.io/sicp/][SICP]]
and the ideas of modeling data from [[https://htdp.org/][HTDP]].

I use Emacs and [[https://orgmode.org/][org-mode]] to write this blog.

If I had more time, I would have written a shorter letter.
