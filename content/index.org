#+title: artiombn's Blog

Hi, welcome to my blog!
I am a programmer passionate about my craft.

I'm working my way through [[https://sarabander.github.io/sicp/][SICP]] ([[https://romanbird.github.io/sicp/][guide]]) and [[https://htdp.org/][HTDP]],
and I really enjoying writing in [[https://racket-lang.org/][Racket]] and functional programming in general.
Of the mainstream languages, I prefer to use Python.

I use Emacs with [[https://orgmode.org/][org-mode]] to write this blog.
