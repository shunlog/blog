#+title: artiombn's Blog

Hi, welcome to my blog! I'm a programmer from Moldova.
I am really passionate about the craft of computer programming.

I've been actively learning programming for 6 years now.
I'm working my way through SICP and HTDP,
and I really enjoying using Racket and functional programming in general.
For day-to-day tasks I prefer Python.

I use Emacs with org-mode to write this blog.
